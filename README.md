A modern, single-file Student Management System built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with glassmorphism UI. Manage personal, family, and academic details with CRUD, search, JSON import/export, bulk sample data, and localStorage storage. Ideal for mini projects, portfolios, and learning web development.

🔹 Extended Description

This Student Database Management System is a complete, modern, single-file web application featuring a sleek glassmorphism UI and fully responsive design. It allows managing personal information (name, register number, department, course, year, semester, gender, blood group, DOB), family details (father, mother, siblings), and academic performance (subjects, internal & semester marks, automatic totals).

The system supports full CRUD operations — add, edit, delete, search — with auto-generated unique student IDs. Data is stored using localStorage, and users can import/export JSON for backup. A bulk sample generator can create hundreds of student entries for testing or demonstration.

Designed to be lightweight, user-friendly, and extendable, it is perfect for college mini projects, resume portfolios, and learning web development. Advanced extensions can include dynamic subject/marks input, charts, PDF/Excel export, login authentication, dark/light mode, and backend integration (Node.js + MongoDB).

This project demonstrates front-end development skills, data management, and UI design, serving as both a practical tool and a showcase for web development learning.
